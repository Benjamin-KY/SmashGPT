As an AI developed by OpenAI, my training process involved several measures designed to increase my robustness and limit my vulnerabilities to adversarial testing. Here are a few relevant points:

1. **Broad Training Data:** I was trained on a diverse range of internet text, which helps me handle a wide variety of prompts and scenarios. However, I should note that while I strive to understand and generate text for a wide array of topics, I don't know specifics about which documents were in my training set or have access to any specific databases, confidential information, or proprietary resources.

2. **Fine-tuning Process:** After the initial broad training, I underwent a fine-tuning process on a narrower dataset with human oversight. This process was designed to help me respond to a variety of prompts in a safe, useful, and ethical manner.

3. **Safety Measures:** Several safety measures were implemented during my training. For example, I won't produce outputs that involve illegal activities, hate speech, or explicit content. I also can't access or reveal personal data unless it has been shared with me in the course of our conversation. I am designed to respect user privacy and confidentiality.

4. **Understanding of Adversarial Attacks:** My training also involved understanding common adversarial attack strategies, such as attempts to trick me into revealing sensitive information or generating harmful content. I am programmed to resist these types of attacks.

5. **Continual Learning and Updates:** OpenAI continuously works on improving me, including my ability to resist adversarial attacks. They take into account feedback and findings from robustness testing and make necessary updates.

However, no system is perfect or completely impervious to adversarial attacks. It's crucial to keep improving the defenses and testing for potential vulnerabilities regularly to ensure the safety and utility of AI systems like me.
